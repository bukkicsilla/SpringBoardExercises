Part One

What is HTTP? 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a way computers communicate on the internet, 
making web pages and data exchange possible.
What is a URL?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that helps find and access websites or files on the internet.
What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phonebook, 
translating website names (e.g., google.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses.
What is a query string?
A query string is extra information in a URL that helps web pages gather specific data or perform actions.
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
Two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. GET is used to request data from a server, 
like loading a web page, while POST is used to send data to a server, such as submitting a form on a website. 
The key difference is that GET is for retrieving information, 
and POST is for sending and updating information on the server.
What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is like asking a server for something on the internet. 
It's a message sent from a web browser or application to a web server, 
specifying what is needed, like a web page or data.
What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is like the answer from a server on the internet. 
It's a message sent back to a web browser or application after an HTTP request, 
containing the requested information, like a web page, or indicating an error.
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
An HTTP header is like a note attached to an HTTP request or response, providing information. Examples:
Request Headers: Accept-Language: fr, Accept: application/json, Response Headers: Content-Type, Location. 
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
1. Browser looks up DNS to find the IP for "somesite.com."
2. Browser sends an HTTP request to that IP for "/some/page.html."
3. Server responds with the requested page.
4. Browser displays the page.

Part Two
1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* 
API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”.
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"

2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
dig +short icanhazdadjoke.com

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser. DONE
