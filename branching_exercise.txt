1. git branch branch_name or git checkout -b branch_name
2. These are git merging strategies. Fast-forward  merge is possible, if there is no conflict. 
   Recursive merging happens when there is a conflict.
3. git checkout branch_name
4. git branch -d branch_name  or git branch -D branch_name
5. If there is a conflict git puts both source code in the file(s) and the conflict has to be resolved manually.
   What is not needed, should be deleted, and what is needed, should be kept in the file(s).
