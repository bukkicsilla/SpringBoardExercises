What is the difference between var and let?
var has a function scope and let has block scope. Both can be reassigned, but only var can be redeclared. 
var declarations move to the top by hoisting, let variables don't do that. 

What is the difference between var and const?

What is hoisting?
Hoisting means that the lines in the code are rearranged. For example var declarations
move to the top before other lines. In this way var variables can be accessed before assignment though they are undefined.
